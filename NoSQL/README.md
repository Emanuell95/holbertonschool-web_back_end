In this project I am working with NoSQL database, which support a variety of data models-including document, key-value, graph, and wide-column-which allow organizations to store structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data without requiring a fixed schema. This flexibility is crucial for modern applications that must rapidly adapt to changing data requirements and integrate diverse data sources.
